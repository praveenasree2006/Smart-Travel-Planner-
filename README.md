The Smart Travel Planner is a Java-based application designed to help users plan their trips in a simple and efficient way.
It takes input such as budget, number of travel days, and user preferences (like beach, nature, or heritage). Based on this data, the system suggests suitable destinations from a list with estimated costs and activities.

The main idea is to save time and effort for travelers by providing:

Personalized destination recommendations

Cost estimation (total expenses based on budget and days)

Travel activities and highlights for each place
